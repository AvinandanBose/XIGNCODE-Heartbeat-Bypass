# XignCode3 bypass
*It is an old XIGNCODE HeartBeat Bypass project. WellBia XIGNCODE Firewall protection sends A0 Packet at certain time intervals.

*This Code creates a host that emulates the packet sent by XIGNCODE. The client listens for this packet. You can use a Hyper-V or any VDS for the host.
